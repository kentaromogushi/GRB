# find GW events and cocincident events 

### description 
1. N_g.py 
    1. is calculate the # of GW events and coincident GW-EM events for Swift and Fermi in O3, O4 (with or without KAGRA), and at the design sensitivity
    2. and need the dataset of estimate local rate density stored in Karelle_revised_brokenOUTPUTHopkins1Gyrtheta_obsGW29theta_c1sigma.txt in 'dataset' directory 
2. coineventO3.ipynb
    1. is for plot the coincident events for a GW detector with Fermi as a function of z
3. sanitycheckN_g.ipynb
    1. is for sanity check of N_g.py
