# Coincident rate estimate and jet constraints from Gamma-Ray Burst and Gravitational Wave observations

### Description 
1. the directory estimate_LF is for 
    1. estimate luminosity function (Schechter LF and broken power LF)
2. the directory estimate_LRD is for
    2.estimate local rate density 
3. the directory constraint_Jet is for
    3. put constrain on the jet geometry
3. the directory rate_GW_and_coincident is for 
    4. estimate rates of GW observations and coincident GW-EM observations
